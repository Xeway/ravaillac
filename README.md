# Ravaillac

A tool to split your file into multiple small fragments.
Reciprocally, from these fragments, it reconstructs the original file.

This has many use cases, like when you want to send a big file on Discord, but you can't send it because of the file size limit required when you don't have Nitro.

Many things are still not available :
- A GUI with Tkinter and potentially also a CLI
- A Discord plugin with BetterDiscord (or even a browser extension)
